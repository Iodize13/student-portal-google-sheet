Creating a website for students to check their scores and attendance using Google Sheets as a
 backend can be a great project. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step process to help you set this up,
 focusing on simplicity and usability:

### Step 1: Plan Your Application

1. **Define Requirements**:
   - Students should be able to log in using their student number ID and password.
   - Teachers should be able to enter scores and attendance in Google Sheets.
   - Students should be able to view their scores and attendance.

2. **Choose Technology Stack**:
   - **Frontend**: Next.js (for server-side rendering and easy routing).
   - **Backend**: Node.js (to handle authentication and Google Sheets API).
   - **Database**: You can use Google Sheets as a database for simplicity.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Development Environment

1. **Install Node.js and Next.js** (as described in the previous answer).
2. **Create a new Next.js project**:
   bash
   npx create-next-app student-portal
   cd student-portal
   ```

### Step 3: Set Up Google Sheets API

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project.
2. **Enable Google Sheets API**:
   - In the API Library, search for "Google Sheets API" and enable it.

3. **Create Credentials**:
   - Go to the "Credentials" section and create a new API key or OAuth 2.0 credentials (for
 user authentication).
   - Download the credentials JSON file.

4. **Share the Google Sheet**:
   - Create a Google Sheet for scores and attendance.
   - Share it with the service account email (if using service account credentials).

### Step 4: Implement Authentication

1. **Set Up Authentication**:
   - Use a simple authentication method (e.g., using a JSON file or a lightweight database like
 SQLite) to store student IDs and passwords.
   - You can use libraries like bcrypt for password hashing.

2. **Create Login and Registration Pages**:
   - Create a login page where students can enter their student ID and password.
   - Create a registration page for new students to sign up.

### Step 5: Connect to Google Sheets

1. **Install Google Sheets API Client**:
   bash
   npm install googleapis
   ```

2. **Create a Service to Interact with Google Sheets**:
   - Create a service file (e.g., sheetService.js) to handle reading and writing data to
 Google Sheets.

3. **Fetch Scores and Attendance**:
   - Implement functions to fetch scores and attendance based on the student ID.

### Step 6: Build the Frontend

1. **Create Pages**:
   - Create a dashboard page where students can view their scores and attendance.
   - Use Next.js routing to navigate between login, registration, and dashboard pages.

2. **Display Data**:
   - Fetch data from Google Sheets and display it on the dashboard.

### Step 7: Test Your Application

1. **Run Your Application**:
   bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the Login and Data Fetching**:
   - Ensure that students can log in and view their scores and attendance correctly.

### Step 8: Deploy Your Application

1. **Choose a Hosting Provider**:
   - You can use platforms like Vercel (which is great for Next.js), Heroku, or DigitalOcean.

2. **Deploy Your Application**:
   - Follow the hosting provider's instructions to deploy your Next.js application.

### Additional Considerations

- **Security**: Ensure that you handle passwords securely and consider using HTTPS for your
 application.
- **User Experience**: Make the UI simple and intuitive for students.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for login failures and data fetching issues.

By following these steps, you should be able to create a simple and effective website for
 students to check their scores and attendance using Google Sheets. If you have any specific
 questions or need further assistance with any of the steps, feel free to ask!

 we could just make register page to enter their email and their student id and their password.
